# Heyo!

## Here are a few things about me:
- Working mainly with Go and C but I recently added TypeScript to my portfolio, other languages I got interest in are Lua, Rust, Nix and Zig.
- Firmware dev at day, DevOps/SecOps by night.
- Rethinking architectures and questioning existing designs. Maybe have a look at [this](https://github.com/u-bmc) to see one of my current projects I maintain.
