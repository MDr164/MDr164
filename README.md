### Greetings!

Here are a few things about this profiles owner:
- Working mainly with Go and C but I recently added TypeScript to my portfolio, other languages I got interest in are Lua, Rust, Nix and Zig.
- Firmware dev at day, DevOps/SecOps by night.
- Rethinking architectures and questioning existing designs

I'm in the midst of reorganizing this profile, updates to this file might happen soon enough :)
